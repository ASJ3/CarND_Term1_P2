    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I broke the training set into 272 mini-batches using a batch size of 128 (because there were 34799 signs in the training set, the last mini-batch size was only 111).\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of epochs in the final model was 30, as increasing that number tended to yield better accuracy, although I changed the learning rate according to the number of period (see next section for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "I used two learning rates:\n",
    "* an initial rate of 0.001\n",
    "* a smaller rate of 0.0001\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially thought about using Stochastic Gradient Descent for optimization, but my model is based on LeNet 5, which uses Adam optimizer. After doing research I learned Adam optimizer tends to converge faster than SGD because it uses momentum, so this is the optimizer I decided on using.\n",
    "\n",
    "My model also uses two convolutional layers, the first one with a 5x5x3 shape and the second with a 5x5x6 shape. I left the stride of these filters unchanged from the LeNet model, with a stride of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 1.000 (see *Training Accuracy* section in iPython export)\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 0.942 (see *Training / Validating the Model* section in iPython export)\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 0.931 (see *Test the Model* section in iPython export)\n",
    "\n",
    "My model is greatly inspired by LeNet 5, as this model was created to categorize pictures of digits and so its architecture is also well suited to recognize other pictures. Also, the size of the image used in LeNet (32x32x1) is pretty similar to the traffic signs images (32x32x3).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end I had to change to 3 the depth of the filter in the first convolutional network, so that it would process the RGB pictures of traffic signs. I also had to change the number of categories in the output layer to 43 (the number of signs types in our data set).\n",
    "\n",
    "After making those changes I ran the model without changing any of the hyperparameters (e.g. initial number of epochs were 10), to see what accuracy I could get. Initial results were pretty good (in the 80-85% range) although not enough to reach the desired 93% accuracy for the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase accuracy I first decided to normalize each image. This was done by taking each pixel, subtracting 128 from it, then dividing it by 128. Each new pixel value, instead of being between 0 and 255, was thus between -1 and 1. Normalization helped reach convergence faster and when running the model again, accuracy increased by about 4% for the validation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other hyperparameters I tried to modify were:\n",
    "* batch size (I tried batch sizes of 96, 128 and 256)\n",
    "* number of epochs (between 10 and 30)\n",
    "* learning rates (between 0.001 and 0.0001)\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the batch sise didn't prove conclusive. In fact, increasing the batch size to 256 significantly decreased the accuracy of the model with the validation set! After a few trials, I decided to leave batch size at 128, identical to the original LeNet 5 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the number of epochs definitely helped increase the accuracy, but usually after the 20th period I noticed some fluctuation of the accuracy on the validation set. Instead of seeing the accuracy steadily increase, it would fluctuate by 1 or 2% percentage points around the 92% mark. I thought this might have to do with the learning rate being too high and creating divergence resulting in the model always \"overshooting\" the local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason why I decided on creating two learning rates: an initial one at 0.001 which I would use to train the model at the beginning; and a smaller rate of 0.0001 used to help the model converge towards a local minimum at the end of the training. \n",
    "\n",
    "After trying different ratios of big v. small learning rate with regards to the number of epochs, I settled on using the big learning rate for the first 26 epochs, then using the small learning rate for the last 4 periods, for a total of 30 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model reached 94.2% accuracy with the validation set, and 93.1% accuracy with the test set.\n",
